# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# TODO: Seed a User from a yml file?

#   :email                 => "admin@xxxxx.xxx",
#   :password              => "123456",
#   :password_confirmation => "123456"
# )
# user.skip_confirmation!
# user.save!

# TODO: Seed an Application
